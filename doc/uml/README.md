Diagrams created from code in commit 8c09a30ca2f4c5d6abe46ef3efcf9fa474e321a6

This directory structure is an attempt to mirror the directory structure of the
Ophyd project.  Wherever a class is defined in a module, the corresponding 
class diagram is represented in this `uml` directory

The `verbose` subdirectory contains object diagrams that include all Class 
methods and attributes

The `condensed` subdirectory contains object diagrams that simply show object
inheritance relationships
