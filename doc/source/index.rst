ophyd
=====

Ophyd is Python package for interactive data collection.

Specifically, ophyd:

* provides tools for specifying scans both simple and complex
* accepts and records experiment metadata in a flexbile way
* supervises scan execution, with the possibility of pauses and interruptions
  based on conditions or user input
* records pointers (e.g., filepaths) to "big" data generated by the scan,
  while capturing "small" data directly
* formats metadata, data, and any pointers into simple "documents,"
  nested mappings of fields and values
* stores a copy of these documents in metadatastore and emits a copy for
  custom applications, including logging, printing to the screen, and
  live plotting

EPICS
-----

Ophyd communicates with hardware using EPICS. All hardware must be configured
with an EPICS driver before it can be used with ophyd.

IPython
--------

Ophyd is designed to be run in IPython, a popular
interactive Python terminal for designed for science. IPython can be
run in a command prompt or accessed in a web-based "notebook" document
through a web browser. Aspects of IPython will look familiar to users of
Mathematica, MATLAB, and other computing environments. It also allows direct
access to the UNIX shell.
